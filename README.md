## Call of Duty 2 RCON Commands ðŸŽ®

This document provides a comprehensive list of RCON (Remote Console) commands for Call of Duty 2 server administration. These commands allow you to manage your server, control gameplay, and interact with players directly from the in-game console.

### How to Use RCON Commands:
1.  Connect to your CoD2 server.
2.  Open the in-game console (usually by pressing the `~` or `` ` `` key).
3.  First, log in to RCON: `/rcon login <YOUR_RCON_PASSWORD>` (replace `<YOUR_RCON_PASSWORD>` with your server's RCON password). You'll typically only need to do this once per session.
4.  After logging in, prefix every command with `/rcon` (e.g., `/rcon say "Hello everyone!"`).
